Here's how you can implement this:  ```python def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:     \"\"\" Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than     given threshold.     \"\"\"     for i in range(len(numbers)):         for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):             if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold:                 return True     return False ```  ### Explanation:  - The outer loop iterates over each number in the list. - The inner loop compares the current number with every subsequent number in the list. - `abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold` checks if the absolute difference between any two numbers is less than the threshold. - If such a pair is found, the function returns `True`. - If the loops complete without finding such a pair, the function returns `False`.  This solution checks all combinations of the list elements, which has a time complexity of \\(O(n^2)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of elements in the list. For small lists, this is usually efficient enough. For larger lists, you might want to explore more optimized approaches, such as sorting the list first and then checking adjacent elements.",
            "To determine whether any two numbers in a list are closer to each other than a given threshold, we can compare the absolute difference between each pair of numbers to the threshold. Here's how you can implement this:  ```python def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:     \"\"\" Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than     given threshold.     \"\"\"     # Sort the numbers to make it easier to find close elements     numbers.sort()          # Iterate through the sorted list and check the difference between consecutive elements     for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):         if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[i + 1]) < threshold:             return True                  return False  # Example usage: print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # Output: False print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # Output: True ```  ### Explanation 1. **Sorting the List**: Sorting the list ensures that if any two numbers are close, they will be adjacent in the sorted list. This reduces the number of comparisons needed, making the function more efficient.  2. **Iterating through Pairs**: By iterating through the sorted list and checking the difference between each consecutive pair, we can quickly determine if any two numbers are closer than the specified threshold. If such a pair is found, the function immediately returns `True`.  3. **Complexity**: The function sorts the list, which has a time complexity of \\(O(n \\log n)\\), and then performs a single pass through the list, resulting in an overall time complexity of \\(O(n \\log n)\\).  This solution is both efficient and straightforward, leveraging sorting to minimize the number of comparisons needed.",
            "To implement the `has_close_elements` function, we need to check if there are any two numbers in the list that have a difference smaller than the given threshold. Here's a possible implementation:  ```python def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:     # Sort the list of numbers first     numbers.sort()          # Iterate through the sorted list and check the difference between consecutive numbers     for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):         if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[i + 1]) < threshold:             return True          # If no such pair is found, return False     return False ```  ### Explanation:  1. **Sorting**: The list is sorted first, which makes it easier to find pairs of numbers that are close to each other. After sorting, any two numbers that are close to each other must be adjacent in the list.  2. **Comparison**: Iterate through the sorted list and check if the difference between each pair of consecutive numbers is less than the threshold.  3. **Return**: If any such pair is found, the function returns `True`. If the loop completes without finding any such pairs, the function returns `False`.  ### Complexity:  - **Time Complexity**: The function has a time complexity of \\(O(n \\log n)\\) due to the sorting step, where \\(n\\) is the number of elements in the list. The subsequent iteration through the list is \\(O(n)\\).  - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \\(O(1)\\) if we do not consider the input list's space requirement, as the sorting and comparison operations are done in place.",

This solution has a time complexity of \\(O(n^2)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of elements in the `numbers` list, due to the nested loops.

We need to account for spaces by ignoring them and ensure that each group of parentheses is balanced and separated. Here's a step-by-step approach:  1. Initialize a list to store the resulting groups of parentheses. 2. Use a counter to keep track of the balance between opening and closing parentheses. 3. Use a temporary list to build each group of parentheses. 4. Iterate through the string character by character:    - If a character is `(`, increase the counter and add it to the temporary list.    - If a character is `)`, decrease the counter and add it to the temporary list.    - If the counter reaches zero after adding a `)`, it indicates the end of a balanced group.    - If a space is encountered, simply ignore it. 5.

Here's the implementation of the above logic:  ```python def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:     # Remove spaces from the input string     paren_string = paren_string.replace(\" \", \"\")          # Initialize variables     result = []     current_group = \"\"     balance = 0          # Iterate through each character in the string     for char in paren_string:         # Append the character to the current group         current_group += char                  # Adjust the balance         if char == '(':             balance += 1         elif char == ')':             balance -= 1                  # Check if the current group is balanced         if balance == 0:             result.append(current_group)             current_group = \"\"  # Reset the current group for the next set of parentheses                  return result ```  This function will correctly separate the groups of parentheses as described in the problem statement.",
            "To solve the problem of separating groups of balanced parentheses, we can iterate through the input string and keep track of the nesting level of the parentheses. We'll use a counter to track the depth of nesting and a temporary string to build each group. When a group is complete (i.e., when the counter returns to zero), we'll add the group to our result list. Spaces should be ignored during this process.  Here's an implementation of the `separate_paren_groups` function:  ```python def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:     result = []     current_group = []     depth = 0          for char in paren_string:         if char == ' ':             continue         current_group.append(char)         if char == '(':             depth += 1         elif char == ')':             depth -= 1                  # When depth returns to 0, we have a complete group         if depth == 0 and current_group:             result.append(''.join(current_group))             current_group = []          return result  # Example usage print(separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')) ```  ### Explanation: - We iterate over each character in the input string. - We skip spaces, as they are not relevant to the grouping. - We append each parenthesis to `current_group`. - We adjust the `depth` counter: increment it for each `'('` and decrement it for each `')'`. - When `depth` becomes zero, it indicates that a complete, balanced group has been formed. At this point, we join the characters in `current_group` to form a string and add it to the `result` list. We then reset `current_group` for the next group. - We return the `result` list containing all separated groups of balanced parentheses.",

Here's a step-by-step implementation:  1. **Remove Spaces**: Since spaces are not important for identifying groups, we can remove them from the input string.  2. **Identify Groups**: We will traverse through the string, maintaining a counter to track the balance of parentheses. A group starts when the counter is zero and we encounter an opening parenthesis. It ends when the counter returns to zero.  3. **Store Groups**: Whenever we reach the end of a balanced group (counter returns to zero), we extract that group and add it to our result list.
